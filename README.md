# Sleepy Thread

## Description

Sleepy Thread is a Python application that demonstrates the use of threading by creating multiple threads that sleep for random intervals. Each thread prints its name and sleep interval upon starting, sleeps for the given interval, and then announces when it wakes up. This project serves as a practical example of implementing and managing threads in Python.

## Features

- Creation of a user-specified number of threads.
- Random sleep intervals for each thread.
- Demonstrates basic threading concepts including thread creation, starting, and sleeping.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Installation

No additional installation required, as the script uses standard Python libraries.

## Usage

Run the script using Python:

```bash
python sleepy_thread.py
```

Input the desired number of threads and the maximum sleep time when prompted.

## Example
```bach
Enter the number of threads: 3
Enter the maximum sleep time: 10
Thread 1 starting, with sleep interval: 4 seconds
Thread 2 starting, with sleep interval: 7 seconds
Thread 3 starting, with sleep interval: 2 seconds
Thread 3 waking up
Thread 1 waking up
Thread 2 waking up
```
